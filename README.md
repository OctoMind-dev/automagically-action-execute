# automagically-action-execute

This is a GitHub Action to execute automagically. 
To use this action a token is required, which you can generate in our [octomind app](https://app.octomind.dev).

See the [docs](https://octomind.dev/docs) for more details.

    url: <publicly accessible url to your deployment>
    token: ${{ secrets.AUTOMAGICALLY_TOKEN }}
    testTargetId: <your testTargetId that you also get from us>
    environmentName: <environment name> that your test cases should run against. optional, 
                     will use the "default" environment otherwise.
    blocking: <if the pipeline should wait for all test results to pass, optional, default is FALSE>

```
